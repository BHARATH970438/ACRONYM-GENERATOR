Acronym Generator :
This Python code prompts the user to enter a phrase and generates the acronym for that phrase.

Usage
Run the code in a Python environment.
Enter a phrase when prompted.

Explanation : 
The user is prompted to enter a phrase, which is stored in the variable s.
The acronym function is defined to generate the acronym for a given phrase.
The input phrase is converted to lowercase using string.lower().
The phrase is split into individual words using string.split(' '), and the resulting list is stored in the variable w.
An empty string acronym is initialized to store the acronym.
The list ex contains words or characters that should not be included in the acronym.
A loop iterates over each word in w. If the word is not in the exclusion list ex, the first character of the word is appended to the acronym in uppercase.
Finally, the acronym is printed to the console.

Feel free to modify the code according to your needs and requirements.
